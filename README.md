### **Project Overview**
This project aims to build an intelligent system that ranks CVs (resumes) based on their relevance to a job description, using historical acceptance decisions. The core objective is to train machine learning models that can predict the likelihood of a candidate being accepted for a given job, and then rank candidates accordingly.
